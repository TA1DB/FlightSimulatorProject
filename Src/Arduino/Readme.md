## Pixel Drawing Project and Library for Nokia 1100/3310 Type PCF8814 MCU Lcd Screens ##

* You can draw multiple shapes directly on lcd screen with this project and library. 

* Normally, original library don't allow to pixel drawing but with this one you can.

* It is using DRAM mapping technique and calculating exact position of pixel to draw on.

I am planning to draw Gyro positions e.t.c. thanks to reading exact position from FSUIPC.
